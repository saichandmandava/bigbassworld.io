      <h2>Adding points of interest (POI) to the webmap</h2>
      <p>Points of interests can be added in game using signs with keywords.</p>
      <h3>Adding a "base" marker : &lt;AM:BASE&gt;</h3>
      <p>Place a sign in the chunk that is on the surface, it doesn't need to be visible in game. Type ".debug chunk"
        ingame to show the chunk border. On the first line
        enter &lt;AM:BASE&gt; and use the next 3 lines to add a label to the marker. The lines will be concatenated and
        separated with single space characters. this markers is intended for major POIs, visible when zoomed far out on
        the map. You don't need more than one for your base. Example:</p>
      <pre>&lt;AM:BASE&gt;
Josh, Joel,
Jesse &amp;
Cordelia</pre>
      <h3>Adding a "misc" marker : &lt;AM:MISC&gt;</h3>
      <p>Place a sign near the minor POI, on the first line enter &lt;AM:MISC&gt; and use the next 3 lines to add a
        label to the marker. The lines will be concatenated and separated with single space characters. These markers
        are visible when the map is zoomed in. They are used to label minor points of interest such as individual
        landmarks in a player's base, roads, lakes, resources gathering areas such as salt domes, etc. Examples:</p>
<pre>&lt;AM:MISC&gt;
Public
salt dome
Free salt!</pre>
      <pre>&lt;AM:MISC&gt;
Drakker's
wonderful
pie oven!</pre>
      <h3>Tagging translocators : &lt;AM:TL&gt;</h3>
      <p>To tag a translocators a sign must be placed within the same chunk as the translocator. Type ".debug chunk"
        ingame to show the chunk border. You can
        hide the sign in the ceiling or the floor if you want. On the first line enter &lt;AM:TL&gt; then on the second
        line enter a tag name, it can be anything. It will be used to classify translocators on the map. For example,
        the Official Public Test Server has an area called the temporal hub, all the transocators in this area are
        tagged with "HUB" and they are shown on the map in a different color. On the third and fourth lines enter a
        label for the translocator. This label will apear in the map object inspector when players hover over the
        translocator on the map with their mouse cursor.</p>
      <p>Note : coloring translocators on the map is left to the discretion of the server admins and the web map
        managers, there's no guarantee that translocators you tag will get a unique color.</p>

      <h3>Adding a "custom" marker : &lt;AM:CUSTOM&gt;</h3>
      <p>If enabled by the server administrator, you can create custom tagged markers. Place a sign and on the first line enter 
         &lt;AM:YOUR_TAG&gt; where YOUR_TAG is any custom tag name you want to use. Use the next lines to add a label to the marker. 
         The lines will be concatenated and separated with single space characters. These markers can be used to create custom 
         categories of points of interest that can be styled differently on the map. Example:</p>
<pre>&lt;AM:SHOP&gt;
Bob's
Trading
Post</pre>
      <h2>Modifying existing POIs</h2>
      <p>Points of interests can be modified in game by altering the text on their signs or moving them or removing them.
        It may take some time before
        the changes are reflected on the web map depending on how often we update it.</p>
